# RPA_Automations
 A folder dedicated for multiple UiPath Automations that I've created and used in production for personal use, freelancing or job clients that allowed me to share the automation.
 
 The automations are based on Robotic Enterprise Structure but in some cases it was reinterpreted in an easier format because the automation wasn't that complicated or didn't use Orchestrator.
 
 The automations use all type of activities based on the needs of the automation and also to be as compatible as possible for the platform it was used on.
